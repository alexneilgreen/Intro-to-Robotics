Robotics Project - Remote-Controlled Vehicle
Overview
Welcome to the repository for our robotics program! The file "sonarMotorCombo.py" contains the source code for our project, providing the functionality for our robotic vehicle. This program is designed to operate the vehicle, incorporating both motor control and sonar sensor functionalities.

File Description
sonarMotorCombo.py: This Python script is the heart of our robotics program. It encompasses the control logic for the motors and the interaction with the sonar sensor, facilitating the vehicle's movement and obstacle detection.
