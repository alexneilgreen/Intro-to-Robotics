**Robotics Project - Remote-Controlled Vehicle**

**Overview**

Welcome to the repository for our robotics program! The file "sonarMotorCombo.py" contains the source code for our project, providing the functionality for our robotic vehicle. This program is designed to operate the vehicle, incorporating both motor control and sonar sensor functionalities.

**File Description**

sonarMotorCombo.py: This Python script is the heart of our robotics program. It encompasses the control logic for the motors and the interaction with the sonar sensor, facilitating the vehicle's movement and obstacle detection.

**About Us**

This project was developed as part of the University of Central Florida's Introduction to Robotics Course. We are passionate about robotics and hope that our work contributes to the wider community of enthusiasts, developers, and researchers. More Files and content about the project will be uploaded soon.
